# AADTMatcher
A dance assignment system for Harvard Asian American Dance Troupe, using an approximate competitive equilibrium from equal incomes (**[A-CEEI](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/eric.budish/research/CourseMatch.pdf)**). Created by Chris En, Secretary '18-'19.

## Requirements
AADTMatcher runs on Python2, although it may be compatible with Python3 with minor code adjustments. You must have **Gurobi** for Python2. To get it, **[sign up](http://www.gurobi.com/registration/download-reg)** for an academic license, then follow the download and install instructions.
___

## Operating Instructions
1. Create the Dance Preferences Google Form for the troupe to fill out. Use **[this template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1q_T8xYxndKK6aVQJ4TMPpFCGnrqIDiPpJclJOwYnMPo)** *exactly*; using the wrong format for questions or question titles will likely break the Matcher, without the appropriate code adjustments. Export and save the response spreadsheet as `preferences.csv`.
  * You may add as many choreographers as you want, just make sure to also update `schedule.csv` (see below).
  * You may add a higher maximum number of dances to join.
  * You may add a larger number of dances to rank, by adding additonal questions for each rank. You must then update the variable `ranks` in `matcher.py` to reflect this change. Title each question "Please select your `x` choice dance.", where `x` is the rank, then append `x` to `ranks`.

2. Update the file `schedule.csv` with the semester's rehearsal information. Each row is for one dance, with columns as follows:
  * `Choreographer`: the name of the choreographer
  * `Day`: the day of the week of the rehearsal
  * `Start`: the start time of the rehearsal, in military time (e.g. 1800 for 6:00pm; 000 for midnight)
  * `End`: the end time of the rehearsal, in military time
  * `MaxCap`: the maximum number of dancers that can be assigned to this dance
  * `MinCap`: the minimum number of dancers that can be assigned to this dance (soft cap)

3. Run the Matcher from the terminal (OSX or Linux - no Windows, please) with `python2 matcher.py`. 

   With the default settings, this can take several hours or more on a single machine. To change the amount of time spent per machine, change `maxTime` in `aceei.py` to the maximum time spent calculating (in seconds).

   Because the algorithm is randomized, the more time spent, the more likely it is to find a better solution. As such, if a perfect solution is difficult to find, it is encouraged to run the Matcher independently on multiple machines (err, parallel processing, amirite?), and select the best result (as determined by the smallest `clearing_error`, which is printed in the terminal once the Matcher has finished).

4. The best allocation found will be exported as a matrix to `allocations.csv`. Each dance's roster and emails will be exported to the folder `rosters/` in the file `[choreographer_name].csv`.
